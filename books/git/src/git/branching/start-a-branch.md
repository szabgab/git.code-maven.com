# Why use branches?

* You might work on several features and bug-fixes at the same time.
* Sometimes you will need to stop working and implement some other changes.
* There might be several people working on different features at the same time.
* Git allows and encourages frequent commits and you'd like to work "in your own corner".


* You want to make it easy for yourself to follow the development of a project while working on your feature.


## What is a branch?

* It is just a name pointing to a specific commit. (sha)
* When we make a commit the currently active branch (if we have one) will move to point to the new commit.
* It is called a branch because after making several commits it will look like a branch of a tree. Especially if there are other branches and they have moved forward as well.
