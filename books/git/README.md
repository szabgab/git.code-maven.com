Got merge notes

* If you don't have time now to deal with the merge (or rebase) conflict resolution, just back out:

git merge --abort

git rebase --abort


* Physical conflict - chaning the same line.

* Automerge works but there is a syntactic or logical conflict that break the code. (compile-time or run-time error)

* Automerge works, but still, how can we know that the result is correct?
