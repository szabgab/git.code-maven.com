## Repositories

* A git **repository** is the collection of all the files and the history of all the changes of those files.
* Usually every (software) project has its own git repository though there are places where they put all the project in the same repository. This is then called a `monorepo`.

* **repo** is usually the shortened version of the name **repository**.

* On GitHub you can store as many `git` repositories as you like. They can be either private or public.
* The names of the repositories are arbitrary.
* Each repository belongs either to a user or to an organization.
* https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO-NAME
* https://github.com/ORGANISATION/REPO-NAME

* Some repository names have special meanings.
* `https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME` - a repository that has the same name as your username is displayed on your profile.
* `https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io` - a repository starting with your username and then ending with `.github.io` is the default for your GitHub web-site.

For me they are
* [https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab](https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab)
* [https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab.github.io](https://github.com/szabgab/szabgab.github.io) (This probably does not exist when you read this. We are about to create it.)
