# Static Site Generators


A Static Site Generator is a program that can take some input text format, usually Markdown, a few HTML templates to define how the pages will look like,
and it can generate HTML pages from these.

There are many Static Site Generators [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/) lists 371, but there are lot more out there.
I wrote at least 3, none of them beingpopular enough to be listed on that page.

There are also other systems that take various data sources (e.g. JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, etc. files) and based on the the data in these file generate lots of HTML files.
These are usually special-purpose systems. We'll see a few of them later on.
