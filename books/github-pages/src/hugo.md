# Hugo


[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most popular Static Site Generators.

It has a nice [Quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) document, that assumes you install it locally on your computer.
It has a nice local build and preview mode.

```
hugo serve -D -b http://localhost:1313/
```
