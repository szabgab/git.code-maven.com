# HTML - view source

* Web sites are built using HTML.
* Look at the source of the page. (Right-click on the mouse and select the `View Page Source` menu item). What you is called HTML. It is very powerful and you can make things a lot more interesting if you learn how to write HTML, but for now we don't want to write that. For now we would like to only think about the content of our web site.
* So we'll use Markdown, which is a very simple and straigh-forward way to write content. We will also use some tool that will convert Markdown to HTML.
