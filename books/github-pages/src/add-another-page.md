# Add page

* Create a file called `about.md`.
* Visit https://USERNAME.github.io/about
* You can use the `[]()` syntax to link to another page in your site or in some other web site. Between the square brackets you add the "anchor text" that will appear on your page, between the parentheses you add the address of that other page. For example this code `[Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/)` will create the following link: [Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/) and `[About](/about)` will display a link with the text "About" that will lead to the page generated from the `about.md` file.
